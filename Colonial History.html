<p>One of the most resource-rich countries in the world, 
the lands and rivers that comprise modern-day Myanmar were highly coveted by the British Crown. A series of three
Anglo-Burmese wars finally resulted in the British Navy overthrowing King Thibaw and the absorption of the kingdom 
into the British Empire, where it would remain until after World War II.
