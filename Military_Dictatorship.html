    The political history of Myanmar (then Burma) post-WWII is incredibly complex. General Aung San, father of 
    currently imprisoned President Aung San Suu Kyi, was a critical force in for success in the Asian-Pacific theater
    during WWII, key player in securing Burmese liberation from the British Empire and central architect
    of the new nation. His assassination on July 19, 1947 was a fundamental turning point in Burmese history that reverberates
    down to today. <br>
</br> A shaky democratic government was overthrown by General Ne Win in 1962, with the country cutoff from the outside world
under a brutal military regime over the next five decades.
